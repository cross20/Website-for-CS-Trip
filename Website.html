<h1><u>The Integrity of Premier League Referees</u></h1>
<h3>By Drew Roberts</h3>
<p>Last Monday, the soccer team Arsenal took on West Bromwich at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal’s home.  Close to the beginning of the game, West Bromwich’s Jay Rodriguez was, to many spectators, clearly fouled inside of the penalty area.  But, the referee did not agree, and no penalty was awarded.  In response to this, Mark Jones wrote an article on The Mirror to bring attention to how often referees give penalties to bigger and better soccer teams as compared to when they give them to the weaker ones.
	In a perfect world, there would be an objective threshold which would determine whether a physical interaction between two players is a foul or not.  Unfortunately, we must depend on a referee each game to make the right decision every time.  Even when the right call is made in a close play, the fans on the side of the team getting the shorter end of the stick many times still complain.  Needless to say, referees deal with quite a bit of pressure, and this article claims that the pressure from the bigger team plays a difference in whether or not penalties are awarded.
	The statistics posted within the article, first off, are ironic, seeing as Arsenal is the last team to receive a penalty and West Bromwich is the team to go the longest without receiving a spot kick at 39 games.  Otherwise, the big clubs in the Premier League seem to be spread out in terms of the last time they each received a penalty.  Tottenham and Chelsea are some of the clubs that have gone longer without one, whereas Manchester City, Manchester United, and Liverpool have recently received one.  Clearly, this isn’t sufficient data to support the claim that bigger clubs are favored by referees, and personally I think this is the wrong factor to be looking at in referees’ decisions.
	Even though the statistics posted don’t provide a clear answer to the Jones’ question, it would make logical sense for bigger clubs to receive more penalties.  Bigger clubs tend to be better overall (people like winning teams over losing), and therefore have better players.  The weaker, smaller teams probably won’t be entering the penalty area as often as superior teams.  Even if they do, the players on the superior teams are going to be more skilled at taking away the ball without receiving a foul.  
	I think that we should be looking at when home teams are awarded penalties instead of away teams.  Typically, home team fans will be louder and have a larger presence in the stadium, therefore having more potential to play a role in the referee’s decision making.  It would be interesting to see the correlation between the home team penalties and away team penalties, and if there even is a relation between the two.

<h1><u>Fingerprint payments in London</u></h1>
<h3>By Chad Ross</h3>
<p>As technology advances, so does its reach. This reach has led to a store in London, called Costcutter, to be the first store in the world to offer fingerprint payments. This exciting new technology comes with a great benefit; there is no longer a need to bring anything with you to the store. Even though leaving your credit card at home may sound exciting, the technology still ignores some shopping inconveniences that other technologies are overcoming.
One inconvenience that the technology ignores is the checkout time. This checkout time, the time standing in line and scanning items, is what takes the longest when trying to leave the store. So, even though completing the transaction only takes “three seconds,” the Amazon Go store will one-up your experience by eliminating checkout completely.
Another problem with the technology is that it stores banking information. This is a problem for many reasons, but, to name just one, it allows hackers to access your banking information as long as they can get past any safeguards in place. This issue is addressed by many mobile payment services (such as Apple Pay), which stores banking information on individual devices and uses unique, one time use, card numbers during every transaction.
Even with these flaws in the fingerprint technology, there are still plenty of upsides. The technology allows for both wet and dirty fingers as well as allows for small cuts. Additionally, since the technology is created by a single company, Fingopay, there is a possibility for numerous stores to accept the same fingerprint without having to copy it for each store individually.
Overall, the fingerprint technology is an exciting innovation that helps improve the consumer shopping experience despite its number of flaws and areas where improvement is needed.

<h4><u>Learnium</u></h4>
<h4>Article by Kristen Cunningham</h4>
<p>Learnium is a social learning platform that is really taking off in many different parts around the world.  It focuses on enabling peer 
teaching, increasing engagement, enabling collaboration, easy file sharing, and being easy to use and saving time.  It is growing in 
popularity because of its balance between being a private social network and a professional network.  This balance is perfect and 
preferred among most students since it allows them to communicate with teachers and other students without connecting their social media
accounts.  Not only does it allow communication, it also encourages communication.  As soon as students starting using Learnium, they 
started to engage with others more. Also, since it was made like many other social network, it is very easy to use.  It has many 
similarities to popular social networks; therefore, it feels very natural.    All of these benefits were key to why Cardiff University 
ended up choosing to use Learnium as their online learning platform.  Their School of Biosciences were looking for a way to allow their 
students to become more active in their own learning, and they were very pleased with the results that Learnium provided.  It is able to 
be bought by educators for a price, which allows them to be able to access more functions, or an account for students can be created for
free.  Free student accounts allow chatting, uploading resources, Microsoft office online, moderation controls, and creating posts.
